**SkillHouse** is a modern, full-stack proof-of-skill microcredentials platform that revolutionizes how skills are verified, shared, and valued. Built for **Appwrite's Hacktoberfest Hackathon 2025**, it demonstrates maximum integration with Appwrite services including Auth, Database, Storage, and Realtime.

## 🎯 Hackathon Submission Highlights

### Maximum Appwrite Integration ✅

This project showcases comprehensive use of **all major Appwrite services**:

- 🔐 **Authentication**: Email/password + OAuth2 with GitHub
- 🗄️ **Database**: 4 collections, 34 attributes, 12 optimized indexes
- 📦 **Storage**: 2 buckets with encryption & antivirus
- ⚡ **Realtime**: WebSocket subscriptions for live updates
- 🌐 **Sites**: Deployed to skillhouse.appwrite.network with SSL/TLS
- 🔒 **Security**: Document-level permissions, encrypted files
- 🚀 **Performance**: Optimized queries, CDN delivery

### Automated Setup with MCP

Includes automated setup script using Appwrite MCP that creates:
- ✅ Complete database schema
- ✅ All collections with attributes
- ✅ Optimized indexes
- ✅ Storage buckets
- ✅ Security permissions

**One command**: `npm run setup:appwrite` - Everything is ready!

## Core Features

- **AI-Powered Badge Descriptions**: Google Gemini generates professional skill descriptions
- **Digital Credential Issuance**: Create verifiable skill badges with evidence
- **Public & Shareable Profiles**: Each user gets a public profile at `/profile/[username]`
- **Peer Endorsements**: Social proof through user endorsements (one per credential)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live endorsement counts and credential updates
- **Discover & Search**: Browse all public verified credentials
- **QR Code Sharing**: Share credentials via QR codes for verification
- **Admin Dashboard**: Review flagged credentials and moderate content
- **Leaderboard**: Rankings based on credentials + endorsements

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up**: Create account with email/password or GitHub OAuth
2. **Create Credential**: Submit skill with evidence (images, PDFs, videos)
3. **AI Generation**: Optional AI-powered description using Google Gemini
4. **Verification**: Credentials get verified status
5. **Endorsements**: Peers can endorse your skills
6. **Share**: Public profile + QR code for verification
7. **Discover**: Browse all verified skills on the platform

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) + [React 18](https://react.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Backend**: [Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io/) (Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime)
- **AI**: [Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) via [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
- **State Management**: React Context API + Custom Hooks
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## Appwrite Architecture

- ✅ Encrypted file storage
- ✅ Antivirus scanning on uploads
- ✅ Unique constraints (username, email)
- ✅ Role-based access control

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment is already configured!**
   
   The project comes with `.env.local` pre-configured for Appwrite Cloud.
   
   *Optional*: Add your Gemini API key for AI features:
   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Appwrite setup is automated!**
   
   All resources have been created automatically:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:appwrite
   ```
   
   This creates:
   - ✅ Database with 4 collections
   - ✅ 34 attributes across all collections
   - ✅ 12 optimized indexes
   - ✅ 2 storage buckets
   - ✅ All security permissions

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit **http://localhost:9002** 🚀

6. **Create your first account:**
   - Go to http://localhost:9002/auth
   - Sign up and start creating credentials!
