## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Port 9002 already in use
```bash
# Kill the process or use different port
npm run dev -- -p 3000
```

### Issue: Can't connect to Appwrite
- Check internet connection
- Verify Appwrite Cloud is up
- Check `.env.local` has correct endpoint

### Issue: Authentication fails
- Clear browser cookies and local storage
- Try incognito/private browsing
- Restart dev server

### Issue: Files won't upload
- Check file size (5MB avatars, 25MB evidence)
- Check file type is supported
- Verify buckets exist (run `npm run setup:appwrite`)

### Issue: TypeScript errors
```bash
# Check for errors
npm run typecheck

# If errors, they're usually import issues
# Check the error message for specific file
```
