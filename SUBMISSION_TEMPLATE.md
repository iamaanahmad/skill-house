## Project Title
SkillHouse: Verifiable Digital Credentials Platform

## Project Description    
SkillHouse is a modern, full-stack proof-of-skill microcredentials platform that revolutionizes how skills are verified, shared, and valued. It enables users to create verifiable digital skill badges backed by evidence, receive peer endorsements, and showcase their expertise through public profiles. The platform features AI-powered badge descriptions using Google Gemini, real-time endorsement updates, QR code verification, and a comprehensive leaderboard system.

Built with Next.js 15 and deeply integrated with Appwrite services, SkillHouse demonstrates a complete production-ready application that solves the real-world problem of skill verification and validation outside of traditional credentialing systems.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
In today's rapidly evolving job market, traditional credentials often fail to capture the full spectrum of an individual's skills and capabilities. Many professionals acquire valuable skills through self-learning, online courses, freelance projects, and practical experience, yet struggle to validate and showcase these abilities to potential employers or collaborators.

I chose to build SkillHouse because I recognized a critical gap: there's no standardized, trustworthy way to prove and share skills that were learned outside formal education systems. Employers waste time verifying claimed abilities, and talented individuals miss opportunities because they can't adequately demonstrate their expertise.

SkillHouse solves this by creating a decentralized, social proof-based credential system where:
- Skills are backed by tangible evidence (portfolios, certificates, project screenshots)
- Peer endorsements add social validation
- Every credential is publicly verifiable via unique URLs and QR codes
- AI helps create professional, objective skill descriptions
- Real-time updates ensure credibility and engagement

This project showcases Appwrite's power to build scalable, secure, and feature-rich applications that solve real problems.
